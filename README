There 're several F*bird versions out there, I was trying to port another one that using phaser.io and pure javascript
to see how making this freaky game. You can freely use my source for any purpose.

Installation
The source comes with nodejs scripting file. If you have installed nodejs already, opening Command Prompt or Console

chdir FAPBird
nodejs webserver.js

Or you can deploy the source to your own webserver. Mine is Tomcat 7.x ;)


FAP FAP FAP your bird
Thanks
